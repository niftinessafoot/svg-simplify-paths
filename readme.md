# svg-simplify-paths
Rounding down excessive SVG path commands.

## Work In Progress
While this technically works, there is *zero* sugar to help it go down. It’s just copypasta at the moment.

### To Do
- [ ] Traverse SVG nodes, auto-pulling paths.
- [ ] Clean SVG output.
- [ ] Incorporate test data.
